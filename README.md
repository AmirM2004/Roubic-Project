# Blindfold Rubik's Cube Solver

This project is a **3D Rubik’s Cube simulator and solver** built with **Three.js** and **Node.js**. It allows users to interact with a virtual Rubik's Cube, perform rotations, and automatically solve the cube using a **blindfold solving algorithm** with iterative deepening search.

## Features

* **3D visualization** of a 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube using Three.js
* **Interactive controls**: rotate and zoom the cube with the mouse
* **Automated solver**: calculates and displays the solution steps for a scrambled cube
* **Step-by-step rotations** with visual updates for each face
* **Node.js backend** for solving logic with API endpoint integration

## Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Three.js
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express, CORS
* **Algorithm:** Iterative deepening blindfold solving

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Start the server with `node index.js`
4. Open the frontend in a browser to interact with the cube
5. Click the **Solve** button to get the solution
